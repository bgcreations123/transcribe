                </h5>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the web sites (collectively, the "Site") of Fourte.com, Inc., including its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Related Companies") (collectively, "Fourte", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Rev and has been created to provide information about our company and transcription, video caption, translation and document related services (the "Services") to our you. This Privacy Policy sets forth Fourte's policy with respect to its processing of two types of data:

                    Personal data that users of our Services ("Customers") ask us to process on their behalf ("Processor Data"), which will include any personal data that Customers provide to us to transcribe, caption, translate, or otherwise process for them. When Fourte processes personal data on behalf of a Customer, Fourte is the "processor" of the data under applicable law, and the Customer is the "controller".
                    Data, including personal data, that we process for our own business ("Controller Data"), other than for our human resources and recruiting operations. This includes, for example, the information we collect through the Site and the names and contact information of our Customers and vendors. Under applicable law, Fourte is the "controller" of such data.
                    Our collection, use, and disclosure of Processor Data:
                    We receive information from or on behalf of our Customers and their users. Because of the nature of the Services, this information may contain any type of personal data, including names, contact information, and other identifying information.

                    Subject to our contractual obligations with our Customers, and depending on the particular Services, we use and disclose Processor Data as follows:

                    Providing Services: To provide, maintain, and improve the Services, including by analyzing the Services and addressing security and business continuity issues.
                    Protecting Us and Others: To enforce the legal terms that govern the Services.
                    Compliance with Laws: To comply with law, and where we deem disclosure appropriate to protect rights, safety and property (for example, for national security or law enforcement).
                    Business Transfers: As part of an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets or reorganization.
                    Consistent with Customer Requirements: For other purposes requested or permitted by our Customers or their users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
                    Subject to our contractual obligations with our Customers, and depending on the particular Services, we share Processor Data as follows:

                    Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, including during negotiations of such an event, Processor Data may be part of the transferred assets.
                    Related Companies: We may also share Processor Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
                    Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Fourte, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include maintaining databases.
                    Legal Requirements: Fourte may disclose Processor Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Fourte, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of the general public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
                    Consistent with Customer Requirements: Rev will disclose Processor Data for other purposes requested or permitted by our Customers or users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
